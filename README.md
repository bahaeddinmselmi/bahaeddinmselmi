## 🧠 About

I’m a **Software Engineer** focused on **backend systems, scalable infrastructure, and AI automation**.

I build software that survives reality:
- high throughput and concurrency  
- messy, real-world inputs  
- reliability and observability constraints  

At **Zaynah AI**, I build backend automation for WhatsApp-based e-commerce, including **NLP workflows for Tunisian Darja** and systems designed to scale in production.

**Operating principle:** execution > noise.
