## 🧠 About

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in **backend systems, AI automation, and scalable infrastructure**.

I design and build **production-ready software** — APIs, automation pipelines, and data-driven systems — built to handle **real-world constraints** such as reliability, performance, and concurrency.

Currently **co-founding Zaynah AI**, where I'm building AI automation infrastructure for WhatsApp-based e-commerce, including **NLP workflows for Tunisian Darja** and high-throughput backend services.

**Philosophy:** Ship systems. Build reliability. Let execution speak.
